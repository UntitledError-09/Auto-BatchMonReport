# Auto-BatchMonReport: Automated Batch Monitoring and Reporting System

**Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system for monitoring and reporting on batch job performance, leveraging data engineering techniques. The system will generate two types of reports: a high-level overview report highlighting patterns in job failures or delays over time, and a detailed report focusing on the most recent job run.

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Collection Pipeline:**
   - Implement a robust data collection pipeline to gather logs and job performance metrics from batch job executions.
   - Utilize SSH access (or API integration) to securely retrieve relevant log data from remote servers.

2. **Data Cleaning and Filtering:**
   - Develop cleaning scripts to preprocess collected logs and extract pertinent information related to job failures or delays.
   - Filter out noise and irrelevant logs to focus on critical data points for reporting.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Reporting:**
   - Apply statistical techniques (similar to those used during the internship) to identify patterns and anomalies in job performance data.
   - Generate high-level reports highlighting trends over weeks/months and detailed reports focusing on the most recent batch run.

4. **Automation and Alerting:**
   - Automate the entire process using Python scripts and Bash commands, scheduled via cron jobs or a similar task scheduler.
   - Implement alerting mechanisms to notify stakeholders in real-time about critical issues detected in batch job runs.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Python:** For building the data collection, cleaning, analysis, and reporting scripts.
- **Bash Scripting:** For orchestrating data collection tasks and integrating with existing batch job execution processes.
- **Data Storage (Optional):** Use databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing cleaned and processed data for historical analysis.
- **Visualization Tools (Optional):** Integrate with tools like matplotlib or Plotly for generating visual reports and dashboards.

**Project Impact:**
- **Efficiency:** Automating data collection and reporting will save time and effort previously spent on manual processes.
- **Insights:** Provide actionable insights into batch job performance, enabling proactive identification and resolution of issues.
- **Scalability:** The system can be scaled to handle large volumes of batch job data.

**Conclusion:**
This project aims to showcase the use of data engineering techniques to enhance monitoring and reporting for batch job executions. By implementing this system, stakeholders will benefit from improved visibility and efficiency in managing and optimizing batch job processes.

# Usage

1. **Data Collection (`data_collection.py`)**:
   - Replace `server_ip`, `username`, `password`, `log_path`, and `local_output_path` with appropriate values.
   - Run the script to connect to the remote server via SSH, fetch logs, and save them locally.

2. **Data Cleaning (`data_cleaning.sh`)**:
   - Modify paths (`LOG_DIR` and `CLEANED_DIR`) to match your environment.
   - Make the script executable (`chmod +x data_cleaning.sh`) and then execute it to clean and filter the downloaded logs.

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Implement functions (`generate_high_level_report` and `generate_detailed_report`) in Python to process and analyze the cleaned log data.
   - Adjust data processing logic based on actual requirements and data structures.

These scripts serve as a starting point and can be expanded and customized further based on specific project needs and infrastructure setup. Make sure to handle security aspects (e.g., SSH credentials) and error handling appropriately in production environments.
